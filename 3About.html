  <h1>Charlie King</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>Photograper and Artist</h3>

    <h4>Artist Bio</h4>
       <p>Charlie King was born in 2001. Growing up he was always expressed an interest in art
    and being creative. He chose to study photography at Sam Houston State university starting
    in 2019 and is planning to graduate in the spring of 2023 with a BFA in photography
    minoring in graphic design and art history.
    While studying photography in college Charlie has been drawn toward alternative processes,
    such as the cyanotype process, tintypes, and film processes in the dark room. Some
    themes that he focuses on include vulnerability, identity, and gender. His work showcases
    diversity in both gender, sexuality, and race, as well as the vulnerability that goes with
    showcasing the human form.</p>
    
   <h4>Artist Statement</h4>
        <p> My photography takes a close look at the human form and how each body and person
    is completely unique but interconnected at the same time. This work is a reflection of
    myself and my identity as well as those that I am photographing. I am a transgender and
    queer individual and my work reflects my identity, struggles, and joy that comes from my
    identity. My artwork explores connectiveness and individuality of people and the human
    condition.</p>
