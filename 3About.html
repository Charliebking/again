  <h1>Charlie King</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>Photograper and Artist</h3>

    <h4>Artist Bio</h4>
       <p>Charlie King chose to study photography at Sam Houston State University starting in 2019 and is
         planning to graduate in the spring of 2023 with a BFA in Photography minoring in Graphic Design,
         Art History, and Studio Art 3D. He will attend University of Houston in the fall of 2023 working on
         his Masters in Photography. While studying photography in college, Charlie has been drawn toward
         alternative processes, such as the cyanotype and tintypes. He also enjoys working with mixed media
         and installation techniques. Some themes that he focuses on include vulnerability, mental illness,
         identity, and gender. Charlieâ€™s work explores diversity in both gender, sexuality, and race, as well
         as vulnerability through self portrait.</p>
    
   <h4>Artist Statement</h4>
        <p> My artwork explores ideas of growing up queer in the south. It examines depression,
          mental illness, vulnerability, and identity and investigates my personal journey through
          photography, ceramics, and installation. Growing up with depression and a history of
          self-harm and suicidal tendencies altered the way that I experienced my childhood and
          adolescence as well as how I view the world. By creating vulnerable work that shares
          raw emotions, it allows me a place to heal and reflect on events in my life. I share
          somber, dysphoric, and deeply emotional moments as well as the joyous, euphoric, and
          happy moments of the trans experience. Trans people are faced with a variety of
          discrimination both by the government and in daily interactions. My work articulates
          my lived experiences with mental illness. I create open dialogues about these topics
          that are often too difficult or shameful to discuss.</p>
